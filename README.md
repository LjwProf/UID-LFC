Firstly, load all the contents of the load folder. These parameters are randomly given by me to test the correctness of the model.
Then, run the simlulink file and use AGC to conduct simulation testing.
Due to the fact that the proposed results have not yet been published online, the controller in Simulink has been dismantled and the allocation algorithm has been changed to the most primitive fixed proportion allocation.
The existing model is now ready for formal operation, and once the paper is officially launched, a complete model will be provided.
